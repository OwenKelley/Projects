<h1>Good and Bad Web Design</h1>
	<p>
	In this assignment we will be looking at more examples of good and bad web design.  To see more examples of good web design, please vist
	<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-design-essentials-examples-and-best-practices/">Smashing Magazines examples of good design</a>
	.  You should read the pages there on best practices.  Look at the examples there and pick 5 examples from the site or anywhere else of Web sites where you like the design.
	I want you to present the pages you like and a description of a minimum of three reasons why you like them in the following format: 
	
	</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>
<h2>Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Computers</a>
<p>
I like this site, because it is simple and balanced.  I like the fact that the designer was not afraid to use a lot of white space on the main page.  I uses a basic color palate consistently throughout the entire site.  
I like the fact that the home page has only a few links to very logical categories.  Even though there are only a few links on this 
homepage, you are only a few clicks from most things you would want to find on the site.

</p>

<h2>First Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<p> The animation on the page is very tasteful and well done. The website flows very well as you scroll. The images are also high quality </p>
<a href="https://aspen.com/">Aspen</a>

<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<p> The header of this website is very nice. Everything they are selling fits and doesn't seem too in your face. The opening website image is also very modern.</p>
<a href="https://www.lights.com/">Lights</a>

<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<p> The animation is tasteful and the opening image is nice. The color palette is also good. I how they display all their information too. </p>
<a href="https://windmill.com/">Windmill</a>

<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<p> The color design is very nice with pink, white, and dark green. They also do a good job of sorting the different plants they sell. The navigation bar at the top is also very good.</p>
<a href="https://www.plants.com/">Plants</a>

<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<p> This interior design website has nice artwork on the main page. The font also work very well with the page and makes it feel sleek. The navigation bar also works well and doesnt get in the way or feel out of place</p>

<h1>The Bad and the Ugly</h1>
<p>For this part of the assignment, I want you to do the same thing you did for the first part, but instead
of what you like, you will be describing what you don't like.  You must include at least three reasons that the site 
you don't like has bad design.  You can find many examples of bad design on this 
<a href="https://blog.rankingbyseo.com/bad-websites/">list of the top 50 worst Web sites</a>
.</p>
<h2>First Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<p> It looks awful. I dont know why there is a smoke shop?? Also if you sell half pouches for $27 and pouches for $4 you will lose money. </p>
<a href="https://www.confetti.com/store/pc/home.asp">Confetti</a>

<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<p> It looks broken. I cannot read the actual logo. The font is way too small. I dont know why the pictures are all on the right...? </p>
<a href="https://elbow.com">Elbow</a>

<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<p> It only uses the left half of the screen. You cannot scroll on the website. I dont know why the pictue has a pixelated border </p>
<a href="http://cardboard.com/pages/1/index.htm">Cardboard</a>

<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<p> The background looks like a popcorn ceiling. I dont like the bronze-y color they used for the text of their logo. There is no navigation or search bar at the top. </p>
<a href="http://hat.com/">Hat</a>

<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<p> This is just funny, but its not a website. The photo of the woman is funny, dont know why it is there. There is literally nothing else on the website, idk what they are copywriting </p>
