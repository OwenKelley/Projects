The main good design choices I was intent on following were having rounded corners on my website, having easy navigation that all have a quick path back to the home page, links that open in a different tab, a consistent formatting to keep each page familiar to the user, and a consistent color pallete that is easy on the eyes.

The main bad design practices I wanted to avoid were animations, and confusing navigation.

This website shows a few of the national parks along the east coast. On the main page you get a summary of the history of the national parks and a quick description of the website. On that same page you can sign up for the mailing list or use the "Contact Us" mailto.

The sidebar on the left of the screen can be used to navigate through the other parks.

Each national park page has pictures from the national park, a description of the park, and a link to learn more about the park if you are interested.
